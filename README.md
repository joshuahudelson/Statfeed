Statistical Feedback external for Pure Data

Copyright (c) 2015 Joshua Hudelson

Statfeed~ is a sound synthesis external for Pure Data.
It generates an audio signal based on the "Statistical
Feedback" process, as described by Charles Ames and
Larry Polansky.

For more information on Statistical Feedback, see Ames'
"Statistics and Compositional Balance" in Perspectives
of New Music, Vol. 28, No. 1, Winter, 1990, pp. 80-111
and Polansky's "A Few More Words about James Tenney:
Dissonant Counterpoint and Statistical Feedback" in the
Journal of Mathematics and Music, Vol. Volume 5, Number 2,
1 July 2011, pp. 63-82.

Work on this external began in June of 2014 at the
Workshop in Algorithmic Computer Music at U.C. Santa
Cruz.  Special thanks to Larry Polansky, David Kant,
Jaime Oliver, and Noah Hudelson for their invaluable help.
